## **INSTALLATION**

### For Windows Users

1. You'll need to start out by downloading git bash <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

2. Then ensure that you have WSL 2 on your machine.

   1. Check to see if you have it:

```powershell
# run this in powershell
wsl -l -v 

#output
NAME        STATE        VERSION
something   something       2 
```

   2. If this is not what you see, then you'll need to either upgrade or install wsl

      - If the wsl command failed, simply run  ```wsl --install```  in administrator powershell
  
      - If it didn't fail, but you have version 1, you'll need to upgrade.
        - **Start at step 3:** <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package>
